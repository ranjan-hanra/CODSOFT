üîê Password Generator ‚Äì Project Description
The Password Generator is a simple Python project that helps users create secure and customizable passwords. It uses Python's built-in random and string modules to generate passwords based on user preferences. The user can choose the desired password length and select whether to include letters, numbers, and special characters. This project is useful for learning basic user input handling, conditional logic, and randomization in Python. It also emphasizes the importance of strong passwords for online security.

Key Features:

User-defined password length

Options to include letters, digits, and symbols

Random, secure password generation

Simple and beginner-friendly Python code

‚úÖ To-Do List ‚Äì Project Description
The To-Do List is a simple Python console application that helps users manage daily tasks effectively. It allows users to add tasks, view their task list, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. This project is great for beginners to practice basic programming concepts such as lists, functions, loops, and user input handling. The project runs entirely in the terminal and provides a simple, interactive menu for ease of use.

Key Features:

Add new tasks

View all tasks with completion status

Mark tasks as done

Delete tasks

Text-based user interface

This project is a foundational step toward building more advanced task management apps with file saving or a graphical interface.

üßÆ Calculator ‚Äì Project Description
The Calculator is a basic Python project that performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a menu-driven, console-based interface where users can input numbers and select the operation they want to perform. The calculator handles user input and includes basic error handling (like division by zero). This project is ideal for beginners learning functions, conditionals, and input/output in Python.

Key Features:

Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

User-friendly menu system

Input validation and error handling

Written using only core Python (no external libraries)

This project is a great starting point for building more advanced calculators with GUI or scientific functions.

‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è Rock, Paper, Scissors ‚Äì Project Description
The Rock, Paper, Scissors project is a fun and interactive Python game where the user plays against the computer. The computer makes a random choice, and the player inputs their choice. The game then compares both choices and declares the winner based on the classic rules of the game. It's a great beginner project to practice conditional statements, loops, user input, and working with the random module.

Key Features:

User vs. computer gameplay

Random computer moves using the random module

Clear win, lose, or tie result logic

Easy-to-understand input/output interface

This project is a perfect starting point for learning game logic and control flow in Python.
